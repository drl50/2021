00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
Hi. My name is Andrew Pastor,

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:09.900
and I am a Content Developer for the Intro to Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
In this lesson, C++ Intro to Optimization,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.260
and the following lesson,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.040
C++ Optimization Practice, you'll

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.525
be using a feature of the classroom that you haven't seen yet.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.960
When you go to the next part of the lesson,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.610
an embedded command line tool will load that looks like this.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.295
Usually, when you use a computer,

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:40.725
you're using your mouse in a graphical user interface to move files around,

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:45.000
open files, create new files, and open programs.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.765
But there's another way that you can use your computer,

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:54.345
and this is with the keyboard and entering commands directly to the computer.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:57.855
So, this is essentially what we've set up for you in the classroom.

00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:59.295
When you open this,

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:03.435
this section of the classroom is actually connecting to

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:09.335
a remote computer that contains files and allows you to run your C++ programs.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:15.310
So, I wanted to give you an overview of what all of this is and how it works.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.490
On a Mac or on a Linux machine,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.685
there's a program called the Terminal that

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.330
allows you to do the same types of things that we're going to do here,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.845
and the equivalent in Windows is called the Console Window.

00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:33.010
So, when you go to the next part of the lesson,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.015
Demo Machine Code, this is going to open.

00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:40.570
And you'll see there are three big sections

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.440
plus a menu down here and then this menu up here.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.290
The menu up here is just to be able to navigate

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.755
the classroom which you should already be familiar with.

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:56.740
This part here is showing you all of the files that are on this remote computer.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.005
So, you can see that because we're in the demo machine code part of the lesson,

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.710
we've automatically set it up that it goes to the folder,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.205
demo_machine_code, and has these two files in it,

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:11.305
which are opening automatically for you.

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:15.310
But you can actually navigate through this with your mouse and see workspace,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.470
and see all the demos in this lesson.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.385
If you double-click on a file or on a folder,

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:25.935
it'll open and you can see the files there.

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:29.160
If you go to the "Back" button,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.010
it'll take you to where you were before,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.200
and you can just navigate it like anything you're probably used to on your computer.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.380
If you right-click, you'll see some options like,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.500
"Open," "Move," which is to move a file to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.145
a different folder "Rename," "Copy," "Download," "Delete."

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:52.236
And then, this "Plus" button is if you want to add a file,

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:56.820
add a folder, or upload something from your desktop that you were doing.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.490
Notice here, it says, "All changes saved."

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.325
So, everything you're doing here it just gets saved automatically.

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:05.820
Anything you type in this part will get saved automatically,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.120
and so you don't have to worry about saving things.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.045
This part right here is a text editor.

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:16.590
So, you can see this instructions.md file is really a text file that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.780
explains what the demo is and then here you have machine code.cpp,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.195
which is a C++ file.

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:27.540
You can actually close these files,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.510
open these files by double-clicking over here,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.820
it works kind of like your regular computer.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.925
So, then, the next part is this big chunk down here where it says,

00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:42.085
"New Terminal, No Open Terminals."

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:45.160
So, this is where you're actually going to be able

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.505
to write commands directly to this remote computer.

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:52.495
So, if I click on "New Terminal" here or on this "Plus" sign,

00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:55.180
it's going to open this New Window.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.475
So, here it says, home/workspace.

00:03:57.475 --> 00:04:03.100
So, that tells me that I'm actually here in the workspace folder.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.905
As you click on this part versus this part,

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:07.765
they're actually not connected.

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:13.450
So, if you want to navigate different folders in the terminal,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.865
you have to actually put commands in to do that.

00:04:15.865 --> 00:04:20.020
The instructions actually talk about and give you the commands that you're going to need.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.910
So, don't worry too much about that.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.415
So, I'm going to go through an example of how you can use this to run your C++ code.

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:33.355
Every time this opens for you in the classroom,

00:04:33.355 --> 00:04:36.940
you're going to see this instruction file,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.950
and it's going to tell you exactly what you need to type in down here and in what order.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.030
You can either just go here and copy these commands,

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.500
and copy and paste them,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.140
and they'll just show up and then you hit "Return" and they'll run,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.515
or alternatively, you can type them out.

00:04:56.515 --> 00:05:00.850
So, without worrying too much about what all of these commands do,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.425
type this in, I'm saying, CD, change directory.

00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:08.080
So now, you can see that in the terminal,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.025
I've changed folders and I'm inside this demo_machine_code folder.

00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:15.565
And then, this next code here,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.655
it is going to compile my C++.

00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:23.770
Okay, and then, you can see over here, this.o file appeared,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.140
and then it says in the instructions to type this out,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.045
and this is the results of the demo.

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:34.060
And if you read through the ReadMe file or this instructions file,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.595
you'll understand what all this is doing.

00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:41.650
The other part I wanted to mention is this menu down here.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.795
So, if this freezes for some reason and it just isn't running right,

00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:49.960
you can always hit "Refresh Workspace" down here.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.865
It's just going to reconnect.

00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:57.745
Your work will be the same everything is saved but it just let's you start over again.

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:01.060
If you want to reset everything and get

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.480
back to the original code that we provided for you,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.160
you'll have to click on "Reset Data," which opens this Window here,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.750
and it says "Resetting data will wipe

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.760
all of your work to restore the project to the original

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.105
state" and then you type in "Reset Data" and click.

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:21.590
I really suggest that you do not reset the data unless you

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.700
have saved all of your work externally and downloaded it because,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.670
for example, if you just want to reset

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.320
these files and you hit "Reset Data," it's going to reset everything,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.315
and you're going to lose all of your work.

00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:37.940
So, make sure that if you need to

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.970
reset the data that you have right-clicked on everything and you've

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.330
downloaded all your code to the desktop or to wherever

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.700
so that you can then upload it again after you've restarted things.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.260
Again, every single one of these lessons,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.990
like Demo Binary over here,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.250
it opens the files for you and gives you instructions and tells you what to do,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.350
and if you want to see the code that is related to all of this,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:10.868
you just click here "Demo Binary" and you've got the instructions file and main.cpp.

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:16.020
So again, what you'll always be doing is you'll be opening this up,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.760
you'll be reading the instructions,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.761
you'll open a new terminal,

00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:23.010
you'll type these commands one at a time,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.515
hit "Enter" and everything will run.

00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:29.130
I am going to provide a link about what all of

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.065
these commands are and what you can do but it's not something that you need right now.

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:38.640
But if you want to study it more and see how you can use

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.505
the terminal not only in the classroom but using it for yourself on your computer,

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:47.895
it's something that is really helpful,

00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:54.560
and it's something that a lot of software engineers need to be able to do. So, thanks.
