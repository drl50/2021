00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.879
So, it's me again, Sebastian.

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.825
Hey, congratulations.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.455
You just completed something quite amazing,

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:10.003
you translated something from Python to C++ and it sounds tedious.

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:14.134
But I hope you learned from some of the basics how programming languages work.

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:15.875
And how different programming languages work,

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.234
because they are different.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:20.800
Both are the main industry standard and both are very important.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.690
Next, we're going to dive into something that

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.510
I had to do a lot of when I was growing up as a programmer,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.420
looking at lower level language functions in

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.590
C++ things like pointers and memory allocation.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.200
Those might sound very cryptic and alienating in the beginning but they're essential to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.550
writing efficient and effective software in

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:43.000
C++ and you need to know them. So let's dive in.
