00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
I'm interested in how learning,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.950
thinking, understanding, reasoning happens.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.970
Machine learning is a place where people are

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.745
trying to figure out how to get it to happen in computers,

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:15.219
which was kind of inherently interesting to me.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.175
So, in the case of something like a self-driving car,

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:21.210
what you need is

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.315
complex environments where there are lots of realistic physical interactions,

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:29.320
and that's why we need richer training environments.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.710
Games are becoming more and more realistic,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.945
so Unity as a game engine is kind of perfectly

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:37.549
positioned to provide what people in the research field need.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:41.184
There's a lot that machine learning can offer to games themselves,

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:45.109
if you start to think about personalizing an experience.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.100
Again, this is something that machine learning could make possible.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.304
Now, kind of with all of these more-and-more complex algorithms,

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.600
we're starting to think about ways in which these algorithms can

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.880
then be applied back to the games themselves.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.899
So, the two problems that game developers face when they're trying to design

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.060
a game is that the game either becomes

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.590
too easy and players get bored with it and stop playing,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469
or that in later levels,

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:13.730
or even from the beginning perhaps,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.969
the game is too difficult and players simply quit because of that.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.469
Praneet is an intern that we had work with

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.474
us in the Machine Learning team over the summer.

00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:25.969
What he's been working on is taking the platform that we're developing,

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.370
and trying to use it in more specific ways that can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.765
actually help provide more interesting games for players.

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:34.284
So, when I started my internship here,

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:37.259
Arthur and me discussed what game we could actually work on,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.859
and we both came to the conclusion that TANKS,

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.090
which is a unity environment,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.034
would be suitable for our task to test out the algorithms.

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:46.780
What if we have a superhuman AI agent,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.920
and actually allow him to adaptively

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.540
change his level of skill based on the way that you play?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.380
It's a much more personalized experience for them,

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:58.609
that you keep on matching their difficulty at every point of time,

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.935
so you can get a more personalized experience.

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.000
I feel that's really cool.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.894
Unlike perhaps older fields from a few decades ago,

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:15.105
the machine learning community is very open in terms of sharing ideas, sharing code,

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:18.169
sharing work, so we think it's a natural fit to continue

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.500
this trend of releasing tools that are open,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.719
that anyone can use and inviting open collaboration.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.099
That's why we're so excited to be releasing an initial preview of this product.
