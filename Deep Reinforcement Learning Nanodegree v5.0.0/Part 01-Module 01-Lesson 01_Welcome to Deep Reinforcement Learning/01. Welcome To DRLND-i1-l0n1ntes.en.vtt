00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome to the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.509
We're so excited that you've joined us.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm Alexis Cook, the curriculum lead for this program.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.405
I'll be your guide through the Nanodegree.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.195
Your journey through the fascinating world of

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:18.615
deep reinforcement learning will start at the very beginning.

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:21.154
So we'll begin by answering the question,

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:24.185
what is deep reinforcement learning exactly?

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:27.929
Well, reinforcement learning is ultimately about

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.149
building code that can learn to perform complex tasks by itself,

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.445
and deep reinforcement learning refers to approaches

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:38.945
where the knowledge is represented with a deep neural network.

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:42.200
For example, maybe you've heard about AlphaGo Zero,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.240
the computer program that's able to beat

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.170
world champions at the ancient Chinese game of Go.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.000
AlphaGo Zero learned for itself how to play without being told any rules of the game.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.740
It just starts playing and then based on whether it has won or lost,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.960
it can assess how good it's strategy is.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.170
Reinforcement learning helps AlphaGo Zero to learn from

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.849
this gameplay experience so that it's able to learn from those wins and losses,

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:12.689
to propose gradually better strategies and eventually master the game.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.064
This trial and error approach can also be extended to other domains.

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:18.890
For instance, to teach a robot to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.670
walk or train a chatbot how to have better conversations.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.329
Companies such as Uber and Google are actively

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.125
testing reinforcement learning algorithms and their self-driving cars,

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:35.784
and Amazon currently uses reinforcement learning to make their warehouses more efficient.

00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:40.534
The possibilities are truly endless and It's widely considered

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:45.545
the technology that brings us closer than never to artificial general intelligence.

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:48.049
While we're still quite far from developing

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.105
a super-human computer that matches human intelligence,

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:53.859
the algorithms you'll learn in this course are

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.319
logical first step in this direction and that's why we built this program,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.654
so that you're able to master this fascinating and potentially world changing technology.

00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:07.489
We can't wait to see where this journey takes you.
