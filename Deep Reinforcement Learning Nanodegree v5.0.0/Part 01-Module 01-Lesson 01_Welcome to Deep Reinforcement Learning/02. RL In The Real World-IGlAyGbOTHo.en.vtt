00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
Throughout this course, you'll be learning from academic and industry experts.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.740
We partnered with Nvidia to bring you information about

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.259
how to apply what you learn in the classroom to the real world.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.839
As you'll soon learn,

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.399
video games provide an excellent environment for developing learning algorithms.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.314
Maybe you've heard about the work at Google DeepMind where researchers trained

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:25.835
a piece of code to show superhuman performance at many Atari games,

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:31.054
and the same algorithms that we used to play games can be adapted for robotics.

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:34.200
For instance, maybe we want to teach a robotic arm to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
touch objects or you want to train a Rover to drive.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.954
The experts at Nvidia will talk to you about their current work in this area.

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:45.978
Later, you'll turn your attention to finance.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:48.799
We'll consider how we might use algorithms to identify

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:52.159
patterns and find opportunities in the financial market.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.619
The idea is that maybe these algorithms can tell us when it's good to buy or sell stocks,

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.034
or how to manage financial portfolios.

00:01:00.034 --> 00:01:03.139
While no one has perfected these applications yet,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.405
you'll get a glimpse into how the very best in the field are pursuing them.

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:10.519
It's important to emphasize that there's a lot of room for

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.935
new ideas and innovation from newcomers to the field,

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:16.100
and that's where you'll come in.
