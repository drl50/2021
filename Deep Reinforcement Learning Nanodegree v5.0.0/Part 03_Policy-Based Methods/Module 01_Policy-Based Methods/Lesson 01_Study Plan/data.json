You can find all of the coding exercises from the lessons in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning).\n\n## Lessons\n---\n\n#### Lesson: Introduction to Policy-Based Methods\nIn this lesson, you will learn about methods such as hill climbing, simulated annealing, and adaptive noise scaling.  You'll also learn about cross-entropy methods and evolution strategies.  \n\n#### Lesson: Policy Gradient Methods\nIn this lesson, you'll study REINFORCE, along with improvements we can make to lower the variance of policy gradient algorithms.\n\n#### Lesson: Proximal Policy Optimization\nIn this lesson, you'll learn about Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a cutting-edge policy gradient method.\n\n#### Lesson: Actor-Critic Methods\nIn this lesson, you'll learn how to combine value-based and policy-based methods, bringing together the best of both worlds, to solve challenging reinforcement learning problems.\n\n#### Lesson: Deep RL for Finance (*Optional*)\nIn this **_optional_** lesson, you'll learn how to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques for optimal execution of portfolio transactions.\n\n#### Resources (*Optional*) \n- Read the most famous [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) on policy gradient methods.\n- Implement a policy gradient method to win at Pong in this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@dhruvp/how-to-write-a-neural-network-to-play-pong-from-scratch-956b57d4f6e0).\n- Learn more about [evolution strategies](https://blog.openai.com/evolution-strategies/) from OpenAI.",
