        "description": "In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.\n\nThe observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.\n\n## Distributed Training\n---\nFor this project, we will provide you with two separate versions of the Unity environment:\n- The first version contains a single agent.\n- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  \n\nThe second version is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  \n\n## Solving the Environment\n---\nNote that your project submission need only solve one of the two versions of the environment. \n\n### Option 1: Solve the First Version\n\nThe task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment,  your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.\n\n### Option 2: Solve the Second Version\n\nThe barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents.  In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,\n- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. \n- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).\n\nThe environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30. \n\n## Evaluation\n---\nYour project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1890/view). Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.\n\n## Project Submission Checklist\n\n**Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.** \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted. \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Project builds correctly without errors and runs.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.\n\n**Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!**\n\n\n## Ready to submit your project?\n---\nClick on the \"Submit Project\" button and follow the instructions to submit!",

You will also learn how to use the Python API to control your agent.\n\n## Step 1: Activate the Environment\n---\nIf you haven't already, please follow the [instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up your Python environment.  These instructions can be found in `README.md` at the root of the repository.  By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.\n\n(_For Windows users_) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. While it might be possible to run the ML-Agents toolkit using other versions of Windows, it has not been tested on other versions. Furthermore, the ML-Agents toolkit has not been tested on a Windows VM such as Bootcamp or Parallels.  \n\n## Step 2: Download the Unity Environment\n---\nFor this project, you will **not** need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:\n\n### Version 1: One (1) Agent\n- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)\n- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)\n- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)\n- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)\n\n### Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents\n- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip)\n- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)\n- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)\n- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)\n\nThen, place the file in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.\n\n(_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.\n\n(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the \"headless\" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)\n\n## Step 3: Explore the Environment\n---\nAfter you have followed the instructions above, open `Continuous_Control.ipynb` (located in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder in the DRLND GitHub repository) and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.\n\nWatch the (_silent_) video below to see what kind of output to expect from the notebook (for version 2 of the environment), if everything is working properly!  Version 1 will look very similar (where you'll see a single agent, instead of 20!).",

If you would like a refresher on GitHub, please check out the lessons on GitHub in the extracurricular content.\n\nTo review the detailed project requirements, please read the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1890/view).  \n\nThe format of this project is largely open-ended; you need only satisfy the points in the rubric.  For instance, while we suspect that the majority of students will train the agent in a Jupyter notebook, you are welcome to instead structure your repository so that your Python code is run from the command line instead.  \n\n## Your GitHub Submission\n---\nAs described in the rubric, your GitHub submission should contain:\n- a **README** that describes how someone not familiar with this project should use your repository.  The README should be designed for a general audience that may not be familiar with the Nanodegree program; you should describe the environment that you solved, along with how to install the requirements before running the code in your repository.\n- the **code** that you use for training the agent, along with the trained model weights.\n- a **report** describing your learning algorithm.  This is where you will describe the details of your implementation, along with ideas for future work.\n  \nThis GitHub repository will serve as a portfolio piece to share your new skills with the global community of reinforcement learning students and practitioners, along with potential employers!\n\n## Project Workspace\n---\nWhile you are welcome to train the agent locally on your own machine, you can also complete the project in the **Workspace** that appears towards the end of this lesson.  Note that the Workspace does not allow you to see the simulator of the environment; so, if you want to watch the agent while it is training, you should train locally.\n\nThe Workspace provides a Jupyter server directly in your browser and has GPU support.  You can learn more about the Workspace by perusing the **Udacity Workspaces** lesson in the extracurricular content.",

We instead decided to solve the project by making some amendments to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm.\n\n### Attempt 1\n\nThe first thing that we did was amend the DDPG code to work for multiple agents, to solve version 2 of the environment.  The DDPG code in the DRLND GitHub repository utilizes only a single agent, and with each step:\n- the agent adds its experience to the replay buffer, and\n- the (local) actor and critic networks are updated, using a sample from the replay buffer.\n\nSo, in order to make the code work with 20 agents, we modified the code so that after each step:\n- each agent adds its experience to a replay buffer that is shared by all agents, and\n- the (local) actor and critic networks are updated 20 times in a row (one for each agent), using 20 different samples from the replay buffer.\n\nIn hindsight, this wasn't a great plan, but it was a start!

You need not follow this advice; these are only suggestions, and you should follow whatever path works best for you!\n\n## Step 1: Master the details of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm.\n---\nRead the [DDPG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) to master all of the details.  Focus on the information in **3. Algorithm** and **7. Experiment Details** to learn how to adapt the implementation for your task.  Refer to the lesson on **Actor-Critic Methods** to cement your understanding.  If you have any questions, post them in Slack!\n\n## Step 2: Study the coding exercise from the lesson.\n---\nIn the **Actor-Critic Methods** lesson, you applied a DDPG implementation to an OpenAI Gym task.  Take the time to understand this code in great detail.  Tweak the various hyperparameters and settings to build your intuition for what should work well (_and what doesn't!_).\n\n## Step 3: Adapt the code from the lesson to the project.\n---\nAdapt the code from the exercise to the project, while making as few modifications as possible.  Don't worry about efficiency, and just make sure the code runs.  Don't worry about modifying hyperparameters, optimizers, or anything else of that nature just yet.  \n\nFor this step, you do not need to run your code on a GPU.  **In particular, if working in the Udacity-provided Workspace, GPU should not be enabled.**  Save your GPU hours for the next step!\n\n## Step 4: Optimize the hyperparameters.\n---\nAfter you have verified that your DDPG code runs, try a few long training sessions while running your code on CPU.  If your agent fails to learn, try out a few potential solutions by modifying your code.  Once you're feeling confident (_or impatient :)_) try out your implementation with GPU support!\n\n## Step 5: Continue to explore!\n---\nRead [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778), which evaluates the performance of various deep RL algorithms on continuous control tasks.  The paper introduces REINFORCE, TNPG, RWR, REPS, TRPO, CEM, CMA-ES and DDPG, and provides some useful suggestions that will help you to figure out which are best suited for the project.",

You are **required** to complete the project with the Reacher environment that was provided earlier in this lesson, in **The Environment - Explore**.\n\n(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Crawler/Crawler_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the \"headless\" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)\n\n## Explore the Environment\n---\nAfter you have followed the instructions above, open `Crawler.ipynb` (located in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder in the DRLND GitHub repository) and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.",
