In this agent's environment, there are no other agents.  However, if we'd like our agents to become truly intelligent, they must be able to communicate with and learn from other agents.  In the final part of this nanodegree, we will extend the traditional framework to include multiple agents.\n\nYou'll also learn all about **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and master the skills behind DeepMind's AlphaZero.",

This feedback is very like the feedback you would receive working on a small team of engineers. Sometimes, a reviewer might ask you to resubmit a project to meet specifications. In that case, an indication of needed changes will also be provided. Note that you can submit a project as many times as needed to pass.\n\nThis feedback is especially useful when building artificially intelligent agents.  Sometimes your agents don't always behave as expected -- see the untrained soccer agents below for an example!
