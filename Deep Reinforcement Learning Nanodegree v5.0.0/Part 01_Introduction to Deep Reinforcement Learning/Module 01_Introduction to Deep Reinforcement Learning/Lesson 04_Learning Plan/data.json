Check out this [blog post](https://blog.openai.com/openai-gym-beta/) to read more about how OpenAI Gym is used to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL) research.\n\n## Learning by Doing\n---\n\nIn the first part of the nanodegree, we’ll be using many of the environments that are available as part of this toolkit:\n\n- You will deepen your understanding of **Dynamic Programming** with the frozen lake environment.  As part of this environment, you'll teach an agent to navigate a world without falling into pits of frozen water.\n- When learning about **Monte Carlo** methods, you'll write an agent to play blackjack.\n- As part of the lesson on **Temporal-Difference** methods, you will teach an agent to navigate a world with a large cliff, where your goal is to avoid falling in!\n- In the **Solve OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v2 Task** lesson, you will train a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers as quickly as possible.\n- In **RL in Continuous Spaces**, you will train an under-powered car to manage a large hill.  \n\nOne of the really cool things about OpenAI Gym is that you can watch your performance.  So, your agent might start off just behaving randomly, but as it learns from interaction, you’ll be able to see it choose actions in a much more calculated, intelligent way.",
