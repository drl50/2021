For instance, you wrote your own implementations of many **_tabular solution methods_** such as **Q-Learning** and **Expected Sarsa**, among other algorithms.  \n\nThen, you learned about how to generalize these algorithms to work with large and continuous spaces.  Using techniques such as **tile coding** and **coarse coding**, you can expand the size of the problems that can be solved with traditional reinforcement learning techniques.\n\nAs you learned in the previous lesson, this lays the foundation for developing deep reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\n### Where are we going?\n---\n**Deep Reinforcement Learning** is a relatively recent term that refers to approaches that use deep learning (mainly multi-layer neural networks) to solve reinforcement learning problems.\n\nIn the next part of the nanodegree, you'll learn all about **Value-Based Methods** (such as the **Deep Q-Learning** algorithm) that use a neural network in place of the Q-table (estimated optimal action-value function) from traditional algorithms.

If youâ€™d like to review this material, we have prepared two lessons that appear in the extracurricular content.  \n\nIn the extracurricular content, you will also find a lesson that introduces PyTorch.  We will use PyTorch throughout this program.  If you are unfamiliar with PyTorch and have time now, you're encouraged to check out the lesson.  (_If not, don't worry - you'll also have time in the second part of the program to learn PyTorch._)",
