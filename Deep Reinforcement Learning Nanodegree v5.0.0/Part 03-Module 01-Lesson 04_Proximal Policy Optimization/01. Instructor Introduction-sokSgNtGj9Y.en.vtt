00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.754
Hi, I'm Tim. Nice to meet you all.

00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:06.129
I'm your new instructor for the deep reinforcement learning course.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.240
Before joining to Udacity team,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.355
I was a post-doctoral researcher in particle physics at UC Berkeley.

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.000
In fundamental physics, if we borrow many tools for

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.789
machine learning and AI to help us model

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.549
complex interactions and derive insights from

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.830
the massive data generated by some of the biggest experiments on Earth.

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.474
From the smallest to the biggest,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.310
machine learning has helped us understand the properties of

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.548
fundamental particles and the structure of the universe.

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:34.320
Looking forward to our lessons.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.509
I'm very excited to share with you some of

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:39.799
the cutting edge developments in reinforcement learning.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.134
I hope you have as much fun as I had creating these lesson materials.

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:45.799
So, let's get started.
