00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.285
You've already learned about how to formulate

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:07.295
a real-world problem so it can be solved with reinforcement learning.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:11.715
In this lesson, you'll begin to think about ways to solve this problem.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:14.310
It's important to note that this lesson is

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.370
significantly more technical than the previous one.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.950
If this is initially uncomfortable to you,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.555
don't worry, and feel free to take the videos at your own pace.

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:27.720
We've added extensive examples and quizzes

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.825
to help you through this relatively difficult content.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:33.705
But you'll likely still need to take your own notes

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:37.290
to make sure that the terminology becomes natural to you.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.285
You should think of reinforcement learning as a language that takes time to learn.

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:44.385
So don't be too hard on yourself.

00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:47.850
With all of this in mind, let's get started.
