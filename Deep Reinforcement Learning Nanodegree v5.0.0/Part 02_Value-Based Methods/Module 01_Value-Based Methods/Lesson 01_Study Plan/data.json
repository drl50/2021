You can find all of the coding exercises from the lessons in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning).\n\n## Weeks 1-2\n---\nFor the first two weeks, you will learn more about how deep learning is used to increase the complexity of the problems we can solve with reinforcement learning.   \n\n#### Lesson: Deep Q-Networks\nIn this lesson, you will learn all of the details behind the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm.  \n\n#### Lesson: Deep Learning with PyTorch (_Optional_) \nWe will use PyTorch throughout this program.  If the PyTorch framework is new to you, please take a look at our introductory lesson in the extracurricular content.  \n\n#### Lesson: Neural Networks (_Optional_) \nFor this course, you are expected to know how neural networks train through backpropagation. If youâ€™d like to review this material, we have prepared this lesson in the extracurricular content.\n\n#### Lesson: Convolutional Neural Networks (_Optional_) \nIf you'd like to review convolutional neural networks, check out this lesson in the extracurricular content.\n\n#### Lesson: Deep RL in Robotics (_Optional_)\nLearn about how to use the Deep Q-Learning algorithm with real-world robotics from experts at NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute.\n\n#### Readings\n- Read this [scientific article](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/cs63/s15/nature15a.pdf) that describes Deep Q-Networks.\n- Read the [research paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) that first introduced the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.\n\n#### Resources\n- Learn more about Deep Q-Learning and Google DeepMind by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN1d3qHMIEQ).\n\n## Week 3\n---\nFor the final week, you will focus on the project.
