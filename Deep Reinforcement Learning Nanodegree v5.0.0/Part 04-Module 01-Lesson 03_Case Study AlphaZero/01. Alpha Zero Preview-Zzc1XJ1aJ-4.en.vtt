00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.905
In 2016, researchers at DeepMind announced a new breakthrough.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.054
The development of a new engine,

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:09.314
AlphaGo for the game of Go.

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:14.119
The AI was able to defeat a professional player Lee Sedol.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.939
The breakthrough was significant because Go was far more complex than chess.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.050
The number of possible games is so high that

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.175
a professional Go engine was believed to be out of reach at that point,

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:31.984
and human intuition was believed to be a key component of professional play.

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:37.740
Still, performance in AlphaGo depends on expert input during the training step,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.530
and so the algorithm cannot be easily transferred to other domains.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.380
This changed in 2017 when the team at DeepMind updated

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.230
their algorithm and developed a new engine called AlphaGo Zero.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.834
This time, instead of depending on expert game play for the training,

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:02.814
AlphaGo Zero learned from playing against itself only knowing the rules of the game.

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:06.730
More impressively, the algorithm was generic enough to be

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.020
adapted to chess and shogi also known as Japanese chess.

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:15.640
This leads to an entirely new way of developing AI engines,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.030
and the researchers call their algorithm Alpha Zero.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.760
The best part of the Alpha Zero algorithm is simplicity.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.125
It consists of a Monte Carlos research guided by a deep neural network.

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.888
This is analogous to the way humans think about board games,

00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:40.424
where professional players employ hard calculations guided by intuitions.

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:42.119
In the following lesson,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.049
we will cover how Alpha Zero algorithm

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.820
works and implement it to play an advanced version of tic-tac-toe.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.359
So let's get started.
