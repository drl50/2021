00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
In this lesson, we'll draft

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.209
several new algorithms to solve the reinforcement learning problem.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.029
We'll begin by reviewing how

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.669
Monte Carlo Control works using our small grid world example.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.504
Remember that we keep track of a Q-table,

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:18.975
it contains for each state action pair the return that we expect to get.

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:22.595
To update the Q-table we sample a complete episode.

00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:26.849
For instance, this episode contains information that we can use to update

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.260
the values of three separate state action pairs in the table.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.880
But for now, let's focus our attention on the first state action pair.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.984
Remember that this is the equation that we can use to update the Q-table.

00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:44.960
Capital G is just the return that was collected by the agent,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.674
and alpha is some small positive number that you set.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:52.754
In this case, the current value in the Q-table is six.

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:55.890
In other words, before we collected the episode,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.649
we would expect that choosing action right in state one would yield a return of six.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.174
But then, after collecting the episode,

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:07.159
we see that we instead got a return of eight.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.609
So, then what Monte Carlo Control does is it updates

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.795
the Q-table to push this value of six a little bit closer to eight.

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.230
You can think of this equation as comparing the return that we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.780
expected to the return that we actually experienced.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.435
Then, if those numbers don't agree,

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:27.350
we change the Q-table just a little so that

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:31.069
our expectations line up better with the reality.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.004
The new value on the table will be something between six and eight.

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:36.795
For smaller values of Alpha,

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.155
it's closer to six,

00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:41.620
and larger values of Alpha will push us closer to eight.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.390
But now, to make sure we're on the same page,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.510
you'll plug in numbers to calculate this update in the quiz question below.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.210
Then, we'll be ready to introduce some new algorithms.
