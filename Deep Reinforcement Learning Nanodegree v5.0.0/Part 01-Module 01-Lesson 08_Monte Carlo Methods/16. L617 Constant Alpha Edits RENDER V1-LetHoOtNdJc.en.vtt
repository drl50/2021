00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
To understand how to set the value of alpha,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.185
we'll look closely at the update equation.

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:09.844
Note that alpha must be set to a number between zero and one.

00:00:09.845 --> 00:00:12.015
When alpha is set to one,

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.160
the new estimate is just the most recent return

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.949
where we completely ignore and replace the value in the queue table.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.875
If we were to set alpha to zero,

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:26.730
we would completely ignore the return and keep the old estimate unchanged.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.734
This is not something that we'd ever want to do because then our agent would never learn.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:36.469
But it will prove useful to set alpha to a small number that's close to zero.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.375
In general the smaller alpha is,

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:42.219
the less we trust the most recent return when performing

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.004
an update and the more we rely on our existing estimate in the queue table.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:51.990
You'll soon get a chance to experiment with setting this value of alpha yourself.
