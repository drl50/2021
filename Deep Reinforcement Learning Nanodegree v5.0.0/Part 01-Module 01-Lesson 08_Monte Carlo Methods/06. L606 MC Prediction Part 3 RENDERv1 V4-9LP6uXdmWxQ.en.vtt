00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
Before you read the pseudo code,

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.235
there's a special case we have to discuss.

00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:06.415
What if, in the same episode,

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:09.890
we select the same action from a state multiple times?

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.330
For instance, say that at time step two,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.810
we select action down from state three,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.370
and, say we do the same thing at time step 99.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.519
I mean, if we count from the first time,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.019
then we get a return of negative 87,

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.914
and if we count from the last time,

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:26.919
then we get a return of 10.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.435
When this happens, we have two options and that gives us two different algorithms.

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.705
We can as a first option,

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:37.719
take the average of both time steps on making the table.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.935
So in this case, we would get a value of negative 38.5.

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.719
Another option that will work well is to

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.960
just use the first time we tried out the state action combination.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.929
So in this case, we would get a value of negative 87.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.259
We refer to the first option as in every-visit Monte-Carlo method,

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:00.454
and we refer to the second option as a first-visit Monte-Carlo method.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.530
To understand where these names come from,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.114
we'll have to introduce some new terminology.

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:07.189
We define every occurrence of

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.109
a state-action pair in an episode as a visit to that state-action pair.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.314
Every-visit Monte-Carlo prediction, averages

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:17.704
the return following every visit to a state-action pair.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:20.429
First-visit Monte-Carlo prediction, considers

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.100
only first-visits to the state-action pair and averages those returns.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:27.854
These algorithms do yield different behavior,

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.030
and you can read more about those differences below.
