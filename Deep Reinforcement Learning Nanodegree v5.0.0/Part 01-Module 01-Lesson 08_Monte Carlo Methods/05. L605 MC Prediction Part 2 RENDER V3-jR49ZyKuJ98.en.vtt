00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
So far we've informally discussed how we might take

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:06.794
a bad policy like the equiprobable random policy,

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:09.330
use it to collect some episodes and then

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.304
use those episodes to come up with a better policy.

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:14.355
Central to this idea,

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:17.670
we build a table that stores the return obtained from visiting

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.820
each state action pair and then this table can be

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.440
used to obtain a policy that's better than the one we started with.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.510
In practice, this table is an estimate for

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.480
how much return is likely to follow if the agent

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.179
starts in a state selects an action and

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:36.390
then uses the policy to select all future actions.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.414
Does this is sound familiar?

00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:42.685
Well, let's recall the definition of the action value function for a policy.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:46.010
It specifies for each state action pair

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:50.489
the expected return that's likely to follow if the agent starts in that state,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.185
selects that action and then henceforth, follows the policy.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:58.290
What's important to note is that's exactly what we estimate with this table.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.009
In particular, we use the table to estimate

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.629
the action value function corresponding to the equiprobable random policy.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:09.949
Remember that we denote the action value function with a lowercase q and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.395
it's popular to refer to this table as a Q table with a capital Q.

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:16.625
Now, this estimate isn't that good,

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:21.000
but the more samples we get the better our estimate will become.
