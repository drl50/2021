00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
In 2015, Google's DeepMind AlphaGo made

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.530
big news in the AI world using deep reinforcement learning.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:14.199
AlphaGo beat a human professional in the very complex game of Go.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.820
We've seen computers win against before those.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.480
So, what was so special this time?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.890
During the game, AlphaGo used original moves that it had come up with on its own.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.435
Moves that taught the world new knowledge about an ancient game.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:36.449
That's because AlphaGo optimized its own moves based on the goal of winning rather than

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.285
say looking at possible moves and

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:43.409
choosing a likely response based on a library of examples.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.879
In robotics, deep reinforcement learning can also

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.465
be used to find the optimal solution to a problem.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:53.060
The Japanese company Fenix,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.755
uses deep RL to reprogram robots to perform new tasks.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:02.390
Traditionally, an industrial robot needs to be precisely programmed

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.694
in a tightly controlled environment in order to do something like grasp an object.

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:10.209
This is expensive and time-consuming.

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:15.979
Fenix robot uses deep RL to train itself to perform a new task.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.969
It tries picking up objects while capturing video footage of the process.

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.579
Each time it succeeds or fails,

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.890
it refines the deep neural network that controls its action.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.233
Warehousing companies that already use robots are looking at deep RL to lower costs.

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:37.399
Companies like Amazon with fulfillment centers that

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.180
deploy thousands of robots are highly motivated to use

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.390
innovative technologies like deep RL to

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.859
optimize their resources and remain competitive in the marketplace.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.329
A number of companies including big companies such as Google, Autodesk,

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.370
and Amazon as well as a myriad of smaller companies and startups,

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.670
are actively working on deep RL solutions in robotics.
