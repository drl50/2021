00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Funded by the National Association of Securities,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.950
dealers the Nasdaq became

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.250
the world's first electronic stock market when it began trading on February eighth 1971.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.330
Since then, people have used computers to sell and buy stocks

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.469
at speeds and frequency that are unmatched by any human trader.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:23.789
The use of computers with pre-programmed algorithms to perform

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.454
traits in the stock market has become known as algorithmic trading.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:30.059
In the past decade,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.225
high-frequency trading or HFT for short,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.160
has become one of the most popular methods of algorithmic trading.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.774
High frequency trading consists of using powerful computers,

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:45.979
with dedicated connections to the stock exchanges to analyze stock data and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:52.344
execute a large number of transactions across multiple markets at extremely high speeds.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:55.759
Despite its assess, high-frequency trading has been

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:59.210
losing popularity due to many factors including;

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.950
the decline in profit margins,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.939
attributed to a decrease in volatility and trading volume,

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.185
high maintenance costs and a large amount of competition among trading firms

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:15.030
that use HFT algorithms to try to detect and outbid each other.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:20.819
Trading algorithms such as HFT make decisions are nanosecond time scales,

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.125
taking human decisions and interaction out of the loop.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:29.025
By contrast, people often look at the news, use high-level analysis,

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:34.435
and sometimes intuition before they make any decisions about a particular transaction.

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:37.579
Ideally, one would like to create an algorithm that

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.760
falls somewhere in the middle of these two extremes.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.450
For example, it'll be ideal to create an algorithm that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.140
can analyze stock data faster than any person possibly could,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.575
but that can make smart decisions like a human trader would.

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:56.825
Allowing you to perform better than any other trading algorithms such as HFT.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.299
Due to its assess in many fields,

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.969
it's not surprising that Machine Learning techniques such as reinforcement learning,

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.694
has gained popularity in creating such fully automated and smart trading algorithms.

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.169
But why use reinforcement learning?

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.375
Why not use more conventional Machine Learning techniques such as supervised learning?

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.860
In the next lesson,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.120
we'll see some of the challenges faced by

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.980
supervised learning in creating such automated trading systems.
