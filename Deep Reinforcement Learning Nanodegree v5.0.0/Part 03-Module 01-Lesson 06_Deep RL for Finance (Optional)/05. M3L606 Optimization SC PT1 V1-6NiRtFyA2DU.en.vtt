00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
We will now take a look at a very common problem in finance known as

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.375
the optimal liquidation problem or how to sell stocks with minimal loss.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.570
So, what is the optimal liquidation problem?

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.240
Let's assume that you have a certain number of stocks

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.865
that you want to sell within a given timeframe.

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:24.254
For example, let's assume you had a million shares that you want to sell within 30 days.

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:30.299
Taking into account the costs arising from market impact and a trader's risk aversion,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.855
the goal is to create a trading list that sells all the stocks,

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:35.534
within the given timeframe,

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:38.909
such that the total cost of trading is minimized.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:45.000
So, this problem talks about market impact and a trader's risk aversion, and so on.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.420
For those of you who are unfamiliar with

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.515
the financial markets may not know what these terms mean.

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.405
So, for the rest of this lesson,

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:57.200
I'm going to give a very simple example that explains what these terms mean,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.480
and what this problem entails.
