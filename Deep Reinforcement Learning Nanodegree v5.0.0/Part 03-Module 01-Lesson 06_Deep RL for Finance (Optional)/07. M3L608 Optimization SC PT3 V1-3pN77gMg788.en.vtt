00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Let's assume I have a total of 12 stocks and

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.984
that the initial price of each stock is a $100.

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:13.574
I will choose to sell my shares in four traits.

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:18.674
Then each trade, I will sell three shares.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.429
For illustration purposes, we will assume that the stock price

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.679
decreases $10 every time we sell three shares.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.170
Let's now calculate the difference between

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.200
my initial holdings and the money I made by selling the stocks in this fashion.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
My initial holdings amounts to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.400
$1,200 and the money that I made by selling the stocks is $1,020.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.225
This gives a difference of a $180.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:59.510
This means that we lost a $180 due to the costs of trading.

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:04.700
This difference between the initial holdings and the money that I made by selling

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.390
the stocks also known as the capture is called the implementation shortfall,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.415
which I will denote with I sub s. Now in reality,

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:24.930
the stock price fluctuates in-between traits and is that as smooth as it is shown here.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.840
So, let's take a look at a more realistic price model.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.260
Stock prices often fluctuate and are not smooth as we saw previously.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.835
So, if we perform the same four traits as we did before,

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.089
we can see that the price at which each trade was

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.280
executed is now different due to the fluctuations in stock price.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.454
So, let's calculate the implementation shortfall for this case.

00:01:53.454 --> 00:02:00.295
Again, we'll have a total of 12 stocks with an initial price per share of a $100.

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:03.665
We're still going to perform the same four traits

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:07.595
and we're still going to sell three shares at every trade.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.969
If we calculate the implementation shortfall for this case,

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.849
we see that now we get $267.
