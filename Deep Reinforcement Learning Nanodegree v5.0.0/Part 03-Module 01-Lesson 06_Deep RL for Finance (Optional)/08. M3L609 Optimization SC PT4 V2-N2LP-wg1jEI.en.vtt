00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.424
Now, if we compare this result to what we had before,

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:08.294
we can see that the implementation shortfall in this case

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:12.675
is bigger due to the random fluctuations in stock price.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:18.690
We can think of this more realistic price model as the original price model,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.030
but with some noise added to it.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.539
So, let's see if we can write this out mathematically.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.809
Here, I have the first implementation shortfall

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.410
which corresponds to trading at this points,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.755
and here is the second implementation shortfall

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.844
which corresponds to trading at these points.

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:40.109
What I want to do now is to express

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.100
the second implementation shortfall in terms of the first one.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.969
To do this, I will start out by writing 97 as 100 minus 3,

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.439
77 as an 90 minus 13 and so on.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.789
If I simplify and rearrange terms,

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.890
I can see that this terms over here in blue actually

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.840
correspond to the capture of the first implementation shortfall,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.909
while these terms in yellow actually correspond to

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.239
the difference in execution price due to noise.

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:15.560
For example, this $3 means that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.215
the first transaction took place $3 below the first implementation shortfall.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:24.799
Similarly, the minus $2 means that

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.814
the third transaction took place $2 above the first implementation shortfall.

00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:37.638
If I simplify further and make the substitution from the first implementation shortfall,

00:01:37.638 --> 00:01:43.429
then simplifying further I actually get that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.669
the second implementation shortfall is actually

00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:51.979
the first implementation shortfall plus some term that just depends on noise.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.880
What I want to do now is actually to write I S1

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:01.269
the first implementation shortfall as E of X,

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:07.024
and I will write I S2 as simply the implementation shortfall.

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:11.390
We call this first term the expected shortfall,

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:17.629
because it is the expected implementation shortfall if we had no noise.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.669
This expected shortfall will depend on how we sell our shares.

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:28.184
For example, if we had decided to sell our shares in this fashion,

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:31.219
by selling five shares in the first trade,

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.009
two shares on the second trade and so on,

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.204
we will have resulted in a different implementation shortfall.

00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:43.085
In this case, a smaller one of $172.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:47.950
The way in which we decide to sell our stocks is called a trade list.

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.079
The trade list tells us the number of trades

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.995
and the quantity of shares to be sold at each trade.

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:59.855
The second term only depends on the random price fluctuations.

00:02:59.854 --> 00:03:02.419
The absolute value of this term gives us

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.659
an idea of how much the stock price is fluctuating.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.865
For example, if we had bigger price fluctuations like here,

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:13.475
we will get a number with a bigger magnitude.

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:16.245
In this case, 253.

00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:19.349
Also notice that in this case,

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.430
the number is negative.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.939
This term will therefore represent how much money we can

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.409
gain or lose due to the random price fluctuations.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:37.280
In finance, this random price fluctuations are referred to as price volatility or risk.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.965
Risk is usually quantified by the variance of the price fluctuations.

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:45.875
So, if the price fluctuations of a particular stock are very big,

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:48.620
we say that is a risky investment.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.909
Now that you have a better idea of what the financial terms mean,

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.500
let's look at the problem once again in this new light.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.199
So, given a certain number of stocks and knowing how

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:04.084
much the stock price is affected every time we sell a stock,

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:09.740
we have to find the trade list that tells us how many shares to sell at

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.230
each trade such that the implementation shortfall is minimized.

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.574
However, we're bound to certain constraints.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:23.474
One of them is that we need to sell theses shares within a given timeframe.

00:04:23.475 --> 00:04:28.485
So, we need to set a limited number of trades within the liquidation period.

00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:33.935
The other is that we need to take into account the traders risk aversion.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:37.264
The traders risk aversion that says how much

00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:40.729
a particular trader is willing to tolerate risk.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.390
For example, suppose the stock we're selling

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.334
is experiencing a large volatility in the stock price.

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:52.039
In this scenario, a trader that doesn't like to

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.060
take risks would rather sell his shares as quickly as possible.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.959
On the other hand, a trader that does like to take

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:05.569
risks will rather sell these shares at a constant rate over the whole liquidation period,

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.290
even if the price volatility is high.
