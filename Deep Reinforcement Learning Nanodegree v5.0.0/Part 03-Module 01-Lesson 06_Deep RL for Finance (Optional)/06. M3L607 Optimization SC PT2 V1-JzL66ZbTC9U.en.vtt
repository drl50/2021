00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.794
Let's begin by understanding market impact.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:08.910
Here we have the price of a single stock over a period of time.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.849
Market impact is the effect that

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.484
a market participant has when he buys or sells a number of stocks.

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:21.268
Since the optimal liquidation problem only deals with selling stocks,

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:24.389
for the rest of this lesson we will only focus on

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.839
what happens to the stock price when we sell stocks.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.000
So, let's see what happens when we sell a stock.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.984
Let's suppose I sell a particular number of stocks right here.

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.914
In general, when you sell a stock, its price decreases.

00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:46.009
In our model, we will assume that the price drops due to two factors.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:50.224
Temporary market impact and permanent market impact,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.554
which we'll talk about in detail in a later lesson.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.520
What we see here is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.050
the permanent market impact on the stock price due to my action of selling.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.799
In this example, my action of selling has caused

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.254
the stock price to drop from $100 to $90.

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:12.484
This permanent impact occurs every time I sell a stock.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:16.099
So, if I sell the same number of stocks right here,

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.809
then I will see the same market impact as before and similarly,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.090
if I sell again here and here.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.775
As we can see, by selling stocks in this particular fashion,

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:31.880
the stock price has decreased from $100 to

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:36.515
$60 due to the induced permanent market impact.

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:39.980
Since the stock price decreases every time we sell,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.385
this means that we're going to lose money.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:46.310
Let's take a look at a concrete example to see

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.519
how much money we would have lost by selling in this fashion.
