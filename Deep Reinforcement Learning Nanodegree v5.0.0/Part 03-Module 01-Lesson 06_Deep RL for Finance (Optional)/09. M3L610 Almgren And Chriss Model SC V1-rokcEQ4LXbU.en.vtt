00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Now, we're going to talk about the Almagren and Chriss model

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.419
for optimal execution of portfolio transactions.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.500
So, the aim of the previous lesson was to give you guys some intuition of what

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.105
the optimal liquidation problem was about without diving into the mathematics.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.420
In this notebook, we will dive into the mathematics and gave

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.790
formal definitions of the terms that we talked about before such as Trading Lists.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.309
Almagren and Chriss provided a solution to

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.459
the optimal liquidation problem by assuming that

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.745
the permanent and temporary market impact functions

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.239
were linear functions of the trading rate,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.565
and that the stock price followed a discrete random walk.

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:43.519
One of the reasons we chose this problem was because the solution given by Almagren and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.680
Chriss gives us a nice benchmark to compare our reinforcement learning algorithm too.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.965
So, we can see how well or how bad our algorithm performs compared to their solution.

00:00:54.965 --> 00:01:00.050
The reason we're taking time to go over their model is because we're going to train

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.570
our reinforcement learning algorithm using

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.355
the same price dynamics and market impact functions that they used.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:10.865
So, you're encouraged to read this notebook to get a better idea

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:13.849
of the equations we're going to use in our training environment.

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.905
I will now give a quick summary of the topics covered in this notebook.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:24.394
We begin by taking a look at the formal definitions for trading trajectory,

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:27.185
trading list, and trading strategy.

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:30.094
This definitions are based on dividing

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:34.730
the liquidation time T into N intervals of equal length.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.280
This number N will determine the number of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.310
trades we will make within the liquidation time.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.909
Here, we see an example of a trading trajectory for n equals 12.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.804
Then, we will take a look at the price dynamics.

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:55.100
We will assume that the stock prices evolve according to this equation,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.214
which describes a random walk.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:00.880
This equation at random noise to the stock price at

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:05.259
every trading step in order to simulate price fluctuations.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.430
We can see what this prize model looks like with this code.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.290
Here, we can see the price model for 60 days.

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:18.973
We can change if we want the number of days to 100, for example,

00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:22.479
and we can also change the random seed to see

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.739
a different realization of the random stock price.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.510
Then, we will take a look at the market impact equations.

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:36.569
This is the equation we're going to use to simulate permanent market impact.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.044
This is the equation that we're going to use to simulate temporary market impact.

00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:44.494
The important thing to remember is that,

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:49.640
Sk tilde is the price at which our sell transactions are going to be executed.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:56.599
In other words, Sk tilde is the price per share that we receive whenever we sell a stock.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.259
Then we will take a look at the equation for capture.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.039
Remember, captured tells us the amount of money that we

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:08.719
make by selling our shares following a particular trading strategy.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.439
We will then take a look at the implementation shortfall.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.234
The implementation shortfall is given by this equation.

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:18.800
This is the equation that we want to minimize

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.500
when determining the optimal trading strategy.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.250
However, since the execution price is random fluctuations,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.729
so will the implementation shortfall.

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.319
Therefore, we have to reframe the problem in terms of the average or

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.969
expectation value of the shortfall and its corresponding variants.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.960
So minimizing the implementation shortfall will entail

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.405
minimizing the expectation value given a particular level of variance.

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:48.919
To solve this problem,

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.769
we will introduce a Lagrange multiplier which is represented by the variable lambda.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.480
So, the problem above reduces to the following: Given

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:03.834
a particular value of lambda which represents the traders risk aversion,

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:09.560
the goal is to find a trading lists that minimizes this utility function.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.694
Finally, we will take a look at the solution given by Almgren and Chriss.

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:20.134
This equations minimize the utility function given a particular value of lambda.

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:25.324
The equation we're more interested in is the trading list given here.

00:04:25.324 --> 00:04:30.425
This equation tells us how many shares to sell at each trading step.

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:33.710
If we sell our shares following the straight lists,

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.109
we'll get an expected shortfall given by

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.504
this equation and the corresponding variance given by this equation.

00:04:40.504 --> 00:04:45.569
In the next lesson, we will take a look at this equations more closely.
