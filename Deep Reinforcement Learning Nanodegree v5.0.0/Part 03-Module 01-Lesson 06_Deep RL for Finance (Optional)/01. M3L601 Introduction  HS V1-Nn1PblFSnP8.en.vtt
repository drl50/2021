00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
Now that you've learned how actor-critic methods work, in this lesson,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.038
we'll take a look at a particular problem in finance,

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:12.179
and formulate it so that it can be solved through reinforcement learning.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.309
In particular, we'll be using

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.640
the deep deterministic policy gradients algorithm to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.615
determine the optimal execution of portfolio transactions.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:24.464
If you're unfamiliar with the financial markets,

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:27.945
don't worry, we'll explain everything step-by-step.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:29.519
But before we dive in,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.039
let's start by getting some intuition as to why

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.043
reinforcement learning is a good alternative to current trading algorithms,

00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:41.750
and why it's better than other machine learning techniques such as supervised learning.
