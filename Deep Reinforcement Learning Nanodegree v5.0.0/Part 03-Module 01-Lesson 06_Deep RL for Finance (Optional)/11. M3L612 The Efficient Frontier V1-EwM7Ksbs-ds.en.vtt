00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
In this notebook, we will take a look at the efficient frontier.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.845
Recall that the expected shortfall and the variance

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.969
of the optimal strategy are given by these equations.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.039
In this notebook, we will learn how to visualize and interpret this equations.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.254
We will start by taking a look at the expected shortfall.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:25.259
Recall that even if we use the same trading list,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.550
we're not always going to get

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.289
the same implementation shortfall due to random fluctuations in stock price.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.390
This is why we had to reframe the problem of finding the optimal strategy

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.149
in terms of the average implementation shortfall

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.629
and the variance of the implementation shortfall.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.298
So, whenever we talk about the expected shortfall,

00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:47.750
we're really talking about the average implementation shortfall.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.994
Therefore, we can think of the expected shortfall as follows.

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:54.289
Given a single trading list,

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.939
the expected shortfall will be the value of the average implementation shortfall.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:03.259
If we were to implement this straight lists in the stock market many times.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.480
To see this in this code,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.620
we're going to implement

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.925
the same trading list for the certain number of trading simulations.

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:14.329
We call this trading simulations episodes.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.679
Each episode consists of different random fluctuations in the stock price.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.500
The code outputs the average implementation shortfall and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.540
the standard deviation of the implementation shortfall for these episodes.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.810
It also outputs the expected shortfall and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.200
standard deviation of the shortfall from the Almgren increased model.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.780
In addition, it also outputs a plot of the implementation shortfall for each episode.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.120
We can see that the implementation shortfall for each episode is different.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.635
For example, for this episode we got an implementation shortfall of around $1 million.

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.555
But for this episode,

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:05.150
we've got an implementation shortfall around minus $500,000.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.655
Remember, that the negative sign means that we actually made money in this episode.

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:16.835
This purple line indicates the average implementation shortfall for all these episodes.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:21.770
We can see that it has a value around $546,000

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.105
with a standard deviation of around $473,000.

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:31.204
We will now see that as we increase the number of episodes,

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:33.980
the average implementation shortfall and

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.319
its standard deviation will get closer to

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.215
the values predicted by the Almgren increase model.

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:44.020
For example, if I set the number of episodes to 100,000,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.380
I now get values for the average implementation shortfall and

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.379
its standard deviation that are pretty close to

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.174
the values predicted by the ongoing increase model.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:59.645
We will then take a look at two extreme trading strategies.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:02.600
The first trading strategy corresponds to

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.919
a trader that has no regard for risk and therefore,

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.679
takes as much risk as possible by selling

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.730
his shares at a constant rate over a long period of time.

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.349
This trading strategy will deal with the lowest possible expected shortfall,

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.159
but it will also yield the largest possible standard deviation.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.319
The second strategy corresponds to a trader that wants to take zero-risk.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.084
Therefore, he sells all his shares in a single trade despite the huge transaction costs.

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:38.270
This strategy would yield the highest expected shortfall,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.210
but will yield the lowest possible standard deviation of zero.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.825
In the last section, we will take a look at the efficient frontier.

00:03:47.824 --> 00:03:51.258
Almgren and Chris showed that for each value of lambda,

00:03:51.258 --> 00:03:54.500
there is a uniquely determine optimal trading strategy.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.139
We will define the efficient frontier to be

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.229
the set of all these optimal trading strategies.

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.500
That is the efficient frontier is the set that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.405
contains the optimal strategy for each value of lambda.

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:12.349
This code plus to the efficient frontier for a range of lambda values.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.155
You can choose a particular value of lambda to

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:18.004
see if it's suspect shortfall and level a variance.

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:21.680
For example, here we see the expected shortfall and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.715
level of variance for a trader with this value of lambda.

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:29.629
A trader that wants to take more risk will be at

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.618
this end of the plot displaying a smaller spectrum shortfall,

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:35.630
but a higher level of variants.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.389
On the other hand, a traitor that also who want to take

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.329
a lot of risk will be at this under the plot,

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:44.019
displaying a much higher expected shortfall,

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:46.639
but at much lower level of variance.
