00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.089
Hi everyone. The paper that you've chosen implements a multi-agent version of DDPG.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.154
DDPG, as you might remember,

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:14.959
is an off policy actor-critic algorithm that uses the concept of target networks.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.320
The input of the action network is the current state while the output is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.769
a real value or a vector representing an action chosen from a continuous action space.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.109
Open AI has created a multi-agent environment called multi-agent particle.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.984
It consists of particles that is agents and some landmarks.

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:39.704
A lot of interesting experimental scenarios have been laid out in this environment.

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:44.714
We've chosen one of the many scenarios called physical deception.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.955
Here, any agents cooperate to reach the target landmark out of end landmarks.

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:53.914
There is an adversary which is also trying to reach the target landmark,

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:58.200
but it doesn't know which out of the end landmarks is the target landmark.
