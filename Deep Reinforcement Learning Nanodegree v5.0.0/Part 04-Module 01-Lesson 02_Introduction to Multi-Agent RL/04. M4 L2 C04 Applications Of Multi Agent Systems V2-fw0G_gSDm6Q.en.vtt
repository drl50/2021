00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
In this video, we will discuss

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.529
some potential real-life applications of multi-agent systems.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.690
A group of drones or robots whose aim is to pick up

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.559
a package and drop it to the destination is a multi-agent system.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.044
In the stock market,

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:18.300
each person who is trading can be considered as an agent and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.850
the profit maximization process can be modeled as a multi-agent problem.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.255
Interactive robots or humanoids that interact with humans and get some task

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:32.494
done are nothing but multi-agent systems if we consider humans to be agents.

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:36.589
Windmills in a wind farm can be thought of as multiple agents.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.930
It would be cool if all the agents, that is,

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.115
the wind turbines figured out the optimal direction to face by themselves,

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.650
and obtained maximum energy from the wind farm.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.689
The aim here is to collaboratively maximize the profit obtained from the wind farm.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:55.464
These are some of the many cases where multi-agent systems can be used.

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.790
In the next video, we will discuss some benefits that come with

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.640
having multiple agents in a system. See you there.
