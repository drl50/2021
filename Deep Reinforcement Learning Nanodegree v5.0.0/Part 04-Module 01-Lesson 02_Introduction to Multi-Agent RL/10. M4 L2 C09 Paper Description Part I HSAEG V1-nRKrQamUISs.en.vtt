00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
The field of multi-agent RL is abuzz with cutting edge research.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.509
Recently, Open AI announced that its team of five neural networks,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.169
OpenAI 5 has learned to defeat amature DoTA 2 players.

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.780
OpenAI 5 has been trained using a scaled-up version of BPO.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.210
Coordination between agents is controlled using a hyperparameter called team spirit.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.625
It ranges from zero to one,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.460
where zero means agents only care about

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.174
the individual reward functions while one

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.959
means that they completely care about the team's reward function.
