Hi everyone, I'm Chhavi,

00:00:02.464 --> 00:00:04.663
a Content Developer at Udacity.

00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:07.734
I'm also a computer science graduate student.

00:00:07.735 --> 00:00:12.150
In this section, I'll be breaking down multiagent reinforcement learning.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.210
Later on, we'll also do a coding exercise to make it clear how such systems work.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's get started.
