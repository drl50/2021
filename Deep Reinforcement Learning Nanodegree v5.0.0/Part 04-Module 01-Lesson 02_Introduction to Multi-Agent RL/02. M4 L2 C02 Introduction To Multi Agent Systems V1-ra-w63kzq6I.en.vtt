00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
In this video, we are going to get an understanding of multi-agent systems.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.550
Multi-agent systems are present everywhere around us,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.800
be it early in the morning when you're making your way

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.260
through traffic to get to work or when

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.914
your favorite soccer players are competing in a game

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:19.664
or when a swarm of bees is trying to build a comb in your garden.

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:24.134
Let's consider a scenario where an autonomous car is driving you to office.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.600
The aim is to reach office quickly and safely.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.760
Anytime it wants to accelerate,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.300
break or change lanes,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.795
it does so while considering the other cars in its vicinity.

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:36.785
Other cars do the same.

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.679
All of them are trying to enhance their driving skills on

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.905
the go as they get more and more driving experience.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:47.765
Contrast this with a scenario where your car is the only car on the road.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:53.120
The fact that now it doesn't have to interact with other cars makes driving much simpler.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.549
This is nothing but a multi-agent system where multiple agents interact with one another.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.299
Agents may or may not know everything about all the others in the system.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.674
A multi-agent system is more complex than a single bond as illustrated before.

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:10.189
In the next few videos,

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.120
we'll dive deeper into this topic.
