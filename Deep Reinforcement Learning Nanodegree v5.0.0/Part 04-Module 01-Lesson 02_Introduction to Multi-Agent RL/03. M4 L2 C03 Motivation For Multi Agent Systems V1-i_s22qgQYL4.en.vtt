00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
In this video, we will seek some motivation for why we should

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:07.199
consider multiple agents in the context of Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.355
Keep in mind that the ultimate goal of AI is to solve intelligence.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.470
We live in a multi agent world,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.065
we do not become intelligent in isolation.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:20.445
As a baby, the closest interactions that shape us are with our parents.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:24.359
In school, we learn to collaborate and compete with others.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.869
We try to predict what might surprise our friends for their birthdays.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.320
We learn from others, and our own experiences, and so on.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.869
Our intelligence is therefore a result of

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:37.054
our interactions with multiple agents over our lifetime.

00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:40.729
If we want to build intelligent agents that are used in the real world,

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.464
they have to interact with humans,

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:44.020
which are just another agent,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.280
and also with other agents.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.054
This leads to a multi-agent scenario.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:52.179
If we really want to solve the problem of intelligence,

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.644
our agents should be able to achieve their goals in very complex environments.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:00.500
The multi-agent case is a very complex kind of environment because

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.079
all the agents are learning simultaneously and also interacting with one another.

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.295
Just like we have in real life,

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:10.560
there are different kinds of interactions going on between agents,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.629
from coordination to competition,

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:14.390
to communication, to prediction,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.709
negotiation, and so on.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:22.799
All these facts motivate us to expand our horizon from single agents to multiple agents.
