00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.285
For this video, let's pretend that you and your sister are playing a game of ball.

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:10.759
You are given one bank or 100 coins from which you plan on buying a video game console.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.609
For each time either of you misses the ball,

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.994
you lose one coin from the bank to your parents.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.980
Hence, you both will try to keep the ball in the game to

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.320
have as many coins as possible at the end.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.484
This is an example of cooperative environment where the agents

00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:31.890
are concerned about accomplishing a group task and cooperate to do so.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.774
Consider that now you both have two separate banks.

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:37.539
Whosoever misses the ball,

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.089
gives a coin from their bank to the other.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.270
So, now instead of cooperating,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.170
you're competing with one another.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.175
One sibling's gain is the other's loss.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:50.419
This is an example of competitive environment where

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.829
the agents are just concerned about maximizing their own rewards.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.939
Notice how in the cooperative setting both you and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.684
your sibling lose a coin while in the competitive setting,

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:05.825
one loses a coin when the other gains a coin.

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:08.060
So, the way reward is defined makes

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.515
the agent's behavior apparently competitive or apparently collaborative.

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:17.269
In many environments, the agents have to show a mixture of

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:20.329
cooperative and competitive behaviors which

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.590
leads to mixed cooperative competitive environments.
