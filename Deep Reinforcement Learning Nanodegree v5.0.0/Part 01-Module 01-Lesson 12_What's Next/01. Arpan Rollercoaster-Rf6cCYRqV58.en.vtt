00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.767
Education can be a little frightening.

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:04.789
When you first start learning a new topic,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.575
there's this realization of how little you know,

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.470
and that can be scary.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.825
It's easy to give up. But, if you stick with it,

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:14.519
if you put the time in,

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.803
then you start to learn, and that's exciting.

00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:19.500
It's thrilling to learn new things,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.519
to put them into action.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.864
I always thought that education was kind of like a roller coaster.

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:28.139
You learn something and it's hard.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.972
It's tough to get to the top of that hill.

00:00:30.972 --> 00:00:33.115
But when you get to the top,

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:36.600
when you figure it all out, it's a rush.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:51.319
It's an absolute ride.

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:56.265
So, congratulations on finishing the ride.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:58.490
We're delighted you made it this far,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.230
and we're looking forward to seeing what you build.
