You can find all of the coding exercises from the lessons in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning).\n\n## Week 1\n---\nMost of reinforcement learning is concerned with a single agent that must demonstrate proficiency at a task. In that scenario, there are no other agents. However, if we’d like our agents to become truly intelligent, they must be able to communicate with — and learn from — other agents. Multi-agent reinforcement learning has many real-world applications, ranging from self-driving cars to warehouse management.\n#### Lesson: Introduction to Multi-Agent RL\n\nIn this lesson, you’ll also explore frameworks and techniques that can be used to train multiple, interacting agents, through a research area known as multi-agent reinforcement learning.\n\n## Weeks 2-3\n---\nDuring the final two weeks, you will focus on the project.  You will also learn about AlphaZero.  \n\n#### Lesson: Case Study: AlphaZero (_Optional_)\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn all about Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and master the skills behind DeepMind's AlphaZero.",
