00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Let's start near the beginning of this CNN.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:07.500
We've talked about how the first convolutional layer in a CNN consists of a number of

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.689
filtered images that are produced as

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.879
the input image is convolved with a set of image filters.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.410
These filters are just grids of weights.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.795
For a convolutional layer with four filters,

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.250
four filtered outputs will be produced.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.740
Each of these filtered output images is also

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.634
called a feature map or activation map because

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.185
each filtered image should extract certain features

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:31.339
from an original image and ignore other information.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.390
For a given image, each of these maps will activate in some way,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.005
displaying activated bright pixels or not in each map.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.050
A good example of a filter is a high-pass filter,

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:44.089
which when applied to an input image creates

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.769
an activation map that activates the most when it sees high frequency features.

00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:51.289
You've programmed your own high-pass filters.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.519
One interesting thing about most CNN's is that as the network trains,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.729
and the weights that make up each convolutional kernel are updated,

00:00:58.728 --> 00:01:03.375
the first convolutional layer often learns to create high-pass filters just like these.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.810
Next, let's learn more about how to visualize

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.079
the filters and feature maps in this first convolutional layer.
