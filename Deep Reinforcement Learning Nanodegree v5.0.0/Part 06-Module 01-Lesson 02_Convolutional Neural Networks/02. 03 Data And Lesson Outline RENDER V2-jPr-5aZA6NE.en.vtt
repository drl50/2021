00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.439
In this lesson, to learn about CNNs,

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:06.529
we'll first talk about the layers that make up an image classification CNN.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.519
You'll learn how to define these layers,

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.605
and what role each plays in extracting information from an input image.

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:14.325
After learning about these layers,

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:16.829
you'll see how to define a CNN that aims to

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.809
classify images from the FashionMNIST data set.

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:21.945
This is a clothing data set that is made of

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:25.050
thousands of images of clothing types like T-shirts,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.980
coats, sandals, and sneakers.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.159
The images in this data set are small in size and preprocessed for ease of training.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.364
We will work with this data set so that you can really focus

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:39.020
on defining a CNN as opposed to data preprocessing,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.000
and so that you can test your neural network without

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.335
needing to use a GPU as you might with larger images.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:50.125
Finally, after defining and training a CNN for classifying items of clothing,

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:53.850
you'll learn and implement some feature visualization techniques that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.439
allow you to see what kind of features your model learns to look for,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.184
and what it sees as an image moves through the layers of a CNN.

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:04.920
Let's begin by learning about all the layers that make up a CNN.
