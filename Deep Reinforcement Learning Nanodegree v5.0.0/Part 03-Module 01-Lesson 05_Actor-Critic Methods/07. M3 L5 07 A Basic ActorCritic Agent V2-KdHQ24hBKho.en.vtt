00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
You know now that an actor-critic agent is an agent that uses

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.070
function approximation to learn a policy any value function.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.384
So, we will then use two neural networks;

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:14.835
one for the actor and one for the critic.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:22.035
The critic will learn to evaluate the state value function V Pi using the TD estimate.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.570
Using the critic, we will calculate

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.935
the advantage function and train the actor using this value.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:33.045
A very basic online actor-critic agent is as follows.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:34.679
You have two networks.

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.674
One network, the actor,

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:41.789
takes in a state and outputs the distribution over actions.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.339
The other network, the critic takes in a state and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.005
outputs a state value function of policy Pi, V Pi.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.065
The algorithm goes like this.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:01:02.554
Input the current state into the actor and get the action to take in that state.

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:08.780
Observe next state and reward to get your experienced double s,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.560
a, r, s prime.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.695
Then, using the TD estimate which is their reward

00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:19.779
r plus the critic's estimate for s prime.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.055
So, r plus Gamma times V of s prime,

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:27.000
you train the critic.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.250
Next, to calculate the advantage a Pi s,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.120
a equals r plus Gamma times V

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.150
of s prime minus V of s. We also use the critic.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.580
Finally, we train the actor using the calculated advantage as a baseline.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:58.099
Easy, right? Let me show you some of the most popular actor-critic agents to date.
