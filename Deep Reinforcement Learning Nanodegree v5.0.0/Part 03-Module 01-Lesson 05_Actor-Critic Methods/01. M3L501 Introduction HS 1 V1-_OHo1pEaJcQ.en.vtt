00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.205
Hi, my name is Miguel.

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:06.160
I'm a software engineer for Lockheed Martin working on autonomous systems.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.449
Lockheed Martin is a global security in aerospace company

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.839
engaged in the production of advanced technology systems.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.359
The majority of our business is naturally,

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.504
with the US Department of Defense.

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:20.309
At autonomous systems in Littleton, Colorado,

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.214
we do all things autonomy,

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:25.274
from traditional robotics to machine learning.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:28.414
In recent years, we have been working on developing

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:32.780
high levels of autonomy in complex missions, and environments.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.910
We've applied deep learning techniques,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.469
including deep reinforcement learning to real-world military applications.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.585
I'm also a part-time instructional associate at Georgia Institute of Technology.

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:48.200
At Georgia Tech, I have the privilege of guiding hundreds of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.660
graduate students every semester through

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.289
their reinforcement learning of decision-making course,

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.659
co-taught by Professor Charles Isbell and Professor Michael Littman.

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.649
In a special teaching sessions,

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.070
I've had the privilege to host

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.239
several prominent contributors to the reinforcement learning community,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.214
including Professor Rich Sutton and Professor Leslie Caubain.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:13.295
Teaching at Tech has been one of the most rewarding jobs I've had.

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:16.174
Finally, I'm the author of the book

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:19.519
Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning by Manning Publications.

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:22.659
Writing a book is unlike anything I have done before.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.569
Teaching in a static medium such as paper,

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.958
and to students of diverse backgrounds poses great challenges,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.174
but it has also taught me many things that I intend to apply to these lessons.

00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:36.950
In this module, I'll be guiding you through one of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.665
the most important classes of algorithms to date,

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.470
Actor-Critic Methods. Let's get started.
