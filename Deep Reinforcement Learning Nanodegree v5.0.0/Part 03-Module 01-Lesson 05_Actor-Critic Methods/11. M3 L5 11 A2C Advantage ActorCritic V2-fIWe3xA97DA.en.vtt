00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
You may be wondering what the asynchronous part in A3C is about?

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:09.435
Recall, Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic. Let me explain.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:13.830
A3C accumulates gradient updates and applies

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.315
those updates asynchronously to a global neuronetwork.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:22.350
Each agent in simulation does this at its own time.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.115
So, the agents use a local copy of the network to collect experience, calculate,

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:33.614
and accumulate gradient updates across multiple time steps,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:39.140
and then they apply these gradients to a global network asynchronously.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.409
A synchronous here means that each agent will update the network on its own.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.724
There is no synchronization between the agents.

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:53.990
These also means that the weights an agent is using might

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.590
be different from the weights in use by another agent at any given time.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:07.299
There is a synchronous implementation of A3C called Advantage Actor-Critic, A2C.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.944
A2C has some extra bit of code that synchronizes all agents.

00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:15.439
It waits for all agents to finish

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.879
a segment of interaction with its copy of the environment,

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:23.839
and then updates the network at once,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.260
before sending the updated weights back to all agents.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.569
A2C is arguably simpler to implement,

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.150
yet it gives pretty much the same result,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.885
and allegedly in some cases performs even better.

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:45.285
A3C is most easily train on a CPU,

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:52.299
while A2C is more straightforward to extend to a GPU implementation.
